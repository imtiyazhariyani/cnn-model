## **Project Description**
This project introduces a preliminary model for predicting single-cell gene expression using chromatin accessibility counts, specifically focusing on oligodendrocyte cells in the human cerebral cortex across various age groups. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), we utilize a published multiomic single-cell dataset (snRNA-seq + snATAC-seq) to train and evaluate the model's predictive performance, utilizing Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a metric. The goal is to decipher gene expression patterns in the developing human brain, with a particular emphasis on the complex relationship between chromatin accessibility and gene expression at the single-cell level.
